# Face-Tracking-Using-Kalman-Filter
We used a Haar-Cascade-Classifier to detect faces. To increase the accuracy of the detected face position we used a Kalman Filter. The output of the Kalman Filter was then used to control servo motors to ensure the face is always in the center of the frame.
# Classifier
The Cascade-Classifier was taken from the opencv repository.
